SwiftGL
=======

This library attempts to make it easy to use OpenGL from within Apple's Swift programming language. For an example of this library in action, please head over to the [SwiftGLDemo](https://github.com/sbennett912/SwiftGLDemo) project.

This includes providing a math library designed to look and feel like glsl (and loosely based on the [GLKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GLkit/Reference/GLKit_Collection/_index.html) and [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net) libraries), as well as including object-oriented wrapper classes and convenience functions to make designing applications which use OpenGL3.2+ faster and easier.
