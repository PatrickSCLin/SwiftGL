SwiftGL
=======

This library attempts to make it easy to use OpenGL from within Apple's Swift programming language.

This includes providing a math library designed to look and feel like glsl (and loosely based on the [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net) implementation), as well as including object-oriented wrapper classes and convenience functions to make designing applications which use OpenGL3.2+ faster and easier.
